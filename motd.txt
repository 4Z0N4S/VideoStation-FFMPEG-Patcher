Please let me now of any issue you could get, the more architectures the script is tested on, the more stable it will be.

Some NAS running on ARMv8 architectures can have troubles with the dedicated patch procedures, if the first attempt fails:
- uninstall + reinstall both VideoStation (keep library) and Advanced Media Extension
- re-run the script using the -f option (curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexPresso/VideoStation-FFMPEG-Patcher/main/patcher.sh | bash -s -- -f)
